### Features

#### 1.) THE BEST ROUTE
Case:<br>
Network is the first thing which is most required for a many technology to work and that’s what gives them a best spot to attack.<br><br>
SOLUTION:<br>
For every time the user uses the app through out the route our app pings the our web server checking if the network is cut out at certain points and stores them so the next the user searches for routes the route with best network is selected out of all possible.

#### 2.) JUST SAY “HELP”
Case:<br>
Now we got the network. What about the cases when you face a sudden attack and you don’t have time enough to make up to you mobile ans press help button.<br><br>
SOLUTION:<br>
Our Alert Mode is the solution keep that on and our app listens for all the words you speak and if it recognizes “help” and that’s all it informs the nearest police ans someone in you app’s friend list who are more close to you than police.

#### 3.) THE BROKEN PHONE
Case:<br>
What if the breaking of the phone is the first move. That’s unfortunate but fortunately we got your back with a idea still to help you out.<br><br>
SOLUTION:<br>
We know the that out app pings to the server to find the best route with network and if it suddenly stops in the place where the network is good you certainly must be in a problem and we will be there to inform and get you help. And yes if the battery is low notification is sent to the server.

#### 4.) TIMING IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT
Case:<br>
What if your phone is thrown away but it is still in a good condition to ping up the server.<br><br>
SOLUTION:<br>
In the Alert mode we have an optional feature to set the estimate time for the journey to end and you can obviously increase the timer and in case you forget we have the alarm to wake you up. Ans yes to extent the timing you must enter he passcode to make sure its was you.

#### 5.) ALL ON THE TIP OF YOUR FINGERS
To provide you with most of the information our app also provides the closest hospital police station and other.
